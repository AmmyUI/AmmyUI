// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/338056/resourcedictionary-in-a-separate-assembly
// I have resource dictionary files (MenuTemplate.xaml, ButtonTemplate.xaml, etc) that I want to use in multiple 
// separate applications. I could add them to the applications' assemblies, but it's better if I compile these 
// resources in one single assembly and have my applications reference it, right?
